DONE - option to make social buttons in eq automatically
SORTA, USED TO VALIDATE - read eq characters by enumerating charname_servername.ini files
DONE - validate fu username and passwords via http
configs by character
DONE - add enable system command (eqclient.ini -> enablesystemcommand=1)
DONE - use a folder to store logs and ability to resend if failed
check if config file from a diff user fucks everything up

how it works

Running vanilla (no params)
- checks to see if its in the correct FuEQ folder, 
	if not assume new install or upgrade depending on existence of FuEQ folder and config file.  
	
	New install creates log folder and config file from default config file (found in FuEQ class)

	upgrade just copies the exe assuming there might be shit in the log folder to process yet, and assuming the config file is okay

	in either case a desktop icon is created, it doesnt seem to care if it already exists

	the installer then spawns the exe in the correct folder as a new process

	the installer exits (leaving the new process running)

- opens config screen
	eq folder is checked to contain eqclient.ini or its invalid
	username / server name are checked vs <username>_<servername>.ini in eq folder (some subfolder) else invalid

	once those 2 things are checked you can get into the socials screen

	lootminutes = how long to check for loot tells once the dump button is pressed to be considered part of this event's loot

	lootlookupminutes = how long to check for tells to you before adding them to the loot lookup that opens in a browser

	fu username/password = for the web site.  Test button checks (vs the website).  When you hit save it won't let you save unless you have a valid logon.  These two values are encrypted before being stored in config file using "this fucking computer/this user" can only decrypt.

- socials screen
	upon load this reads the socials from your toon_server.ini file and makes a mockup of the eq socials thing

	CLICK A SOCIAL to edit it

	the edits allowed are 
		- change this social to one of the 4 needed Buttons
		- clear (delete) this social
	When the changes are made to toon_server.ini, the user is annoyingly prompted to not fuck this up
	As advertised, don't be in eq when you change this stuff (maybe at server select is ok?)

	the buttons are in the same format as piyper's buttons, ie
	/system "<path to this executable>" command yourtoon param1

	the 4 buttons are currently stored, perhaps awkwardly, as subclasses of FuEQ.SocialButton

	the parameters and username for the commands come from the current config(?) when an edit/delete button is pressed

Running with params

	When this app is called with command line params, it is usually being run by EQ in response to a click on a social

	The only configurable settings used during this part come from the command line (so, the config file is not used) except for eqfolder (eqlogfolder) and the http username/password
	Theoretically you could set up 2 toons as long as they had the same eq folder - I have not yet added support for multiple eq folders

	the commands are
	- config (the default when run with no params, opens config screen blah blah)
	- loot
		- builds a parsed log out of guild tells relevant to loot
		- saves it in log folder
		- send update is called which:
			- looks for incomplete and new logs in folder
			- tries to send all of them (to a service that I havent written yet.  Version 1 will be "copy the uploaded stuff to the ftp folder and call the php that updates out of the ftp folder") via form POST
			- marks them as complete or incomplete again

	- loot lookup
		- grabs the last x minutes of tells, where x is a param that was passed by the button
		- makes a list of the names
		- opens a browser to fublahblah/lootlookup w the names on the querystring

	- attendance
		- doesnt work yet

	- guildroster
		- doesnt work yet
